# Data-wrangling_Udacity
The dataset that I will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent".  WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage. This project will go through 3 stages (Gathering, Assessing and Cleaning) in order to gain a clean and combined dataset and identify at least eight quality issues and two tidiness issues.
